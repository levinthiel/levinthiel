## Code & Coffee ☕️
Welcome to my little corner of the coding universe! 🚀 <br/>
I’m just a caffeine-fueled nerd trying to turn coffee into code. </br>
If you find any bugs 🪲, please return them to the wild — no questions asked. <br/>
Enjoy the chaos!

💬we can talk about about books, comics, movies, games....🔭 I love everything sci-fi
